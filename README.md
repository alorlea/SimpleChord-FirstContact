SimpleChord-FirstContact
========================

In the last assignment we studied the chord, distributed hash table and we implemented a simple chord implementation following the assignment guidelines. For the seminar, they asked to implement the system up to the handling failures section. This version does not implement replication as in the original paper. This assignment was part of one of the distributed system courses at KTH.
